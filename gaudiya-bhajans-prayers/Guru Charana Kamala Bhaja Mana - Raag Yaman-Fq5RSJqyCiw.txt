TRANSLATION
Refrain: O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master.
 
1) Without receiving the mercy of the pure devotee, one will not have the potency to execute regulative spiritual practices. Therefore, O my dear mind, I urge you to worship him, please worship him at every moment.
 
2) O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master. While the fallen soul wanders throughout the fourteen worlds, it rarely gets an opportunity to receive a human birth. And out of so many human beings, only a few receive the great fortune of meeting the devotees of Lord Hari.
 
3) O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master. Sri Guru is the personification of the bliss inherent in Krsna’s causeless mercy, and he is therefore the abode of mercy for souls who are suffering in the material world. He is the revealer of transcendental knowledge, pure devotion, and divine love. Sri Guru is the savior of fallen conditioned souls.
 
4) O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master. His glories are clearly confirmed by the assembly of sruti sastras, smrti-sastras, as well as in the commentaries of the great acaryas. Just offer your body, mind, and life itself at the lotus feet of Sri Guru and always remain engaged in the chanting of Hari Nama.
